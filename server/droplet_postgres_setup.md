This description aims towards setting up a TEST environment with a Droplet with postgresql db and connecting to it from a local machine with PGadmin4, QGIS 3.0 and Notepad++. For further use of this test environment one should set up extra security.

1) Spin up Ubuntu 16 Droplet (https://www.digitalocean.com/). First time with droplet IP and user `root` and droplet password (sent to your mail).

2) Set up Droplet (use Putty or local terminal), user and Add Public Key Authentication (optional - delete password login 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04. Jump step about ssh-copy-id eller cat to server and copy-paste content of public key instead 

3) Now you should be able to access the server from your local machine with putty or terminal. With Putty access with IP + user/pass og SSH access. With terminal write `SSH username@IP` (the first login ask for info).

4) Install nodejs og npm

5) Install postgresql

6) Install pgadmin p√• local windows

7) Prepare postgres for remote connection (OBS! no security steps are taking into consideration)
- On the server go to /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/ and `sudo nano pg_hba.conf` and insert at the buttom `host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5`. Save and exit.
- On the server go to /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/ and `sudo nano postgresql.conf` and replace `#listen_addresses = 'localhost'` with `listen_addresses = '*'` Save and exit.
